    #todo do -> the goal is to find relation in each level which can decrease the enthropy tp zero.
    # then it is like knowing by features (algebra)-> which properties can be find in each level 
    # Also it is ajusta tet Ã¥project for python this is why this algorithm is vague and there is no
    # value continuig it.
    # This method is aimed for biological/ scattering real targets not prime num.
